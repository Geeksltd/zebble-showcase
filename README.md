# Zebble showcase
A showcase app to explain how to build apps with Zebble.

Its functionality will be similar to https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geeks-xamarin/id1166606853

For each page, there will be a Code icon at the top right corner to show how that page is developed, with a description at the top, followed by the code in the following sections:
ViewModel|Zbl markup|Zbl codebehind|Css
